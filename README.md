## part 1

## short answer question.

# Question 1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

# Answers: PyTorch emphasizes a Pythonic, flexible, and imperative approach, making it the top choice for research and rapid prototyping. TensorFlow, on the other hand, provides a more robust and complete ecosystem for production-scale deployment.

# Question 2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

# Answers: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and rapid model prototyping.

# Question 3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

# Answers: Using basic Python string operations for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a low-level, manual process that lacks an understanding of linguistic rules, context, and semantics. In contrast, using a purpose-built library like spaCy transforms text into a rich, object-oriented data structure that provides a host of pre-built, advanced linguistic features and is optimized for performance.

## Comparative Analysis

**Target Applications**

Scikit-learn: Ideal for traditional, classical machine learning tasks like classification, regression, and clustering, typically using structured (tabular) data. It is suitable for small- to medium-sized datasets.

TensorFlow: Built for deep learning and large-scale, complex neural network applications, especially with unstructured data like images, audio, and text. It is designed for large datasets and distributed computing.

**Ease of Use for Beginners**

Scikit-learn: Very beginner-friendly with a high-level, consistent API based on a simple "fit and predict" paradigm. It has a gentle learning curve for those new to machine learning.

TensorFlow: Steeper learning curve due to its advanced features and greater complexity. The high-level Keras API simplifies model building, making it more accessible, but understanding underlying concepts is beneficial.

**Community Support**

Scikit-learn: Strong support within the academic and general machine learning community, with vast documentation and resources. Integrates seamlessly with other core Python data science libraries.

TensorFlow: A massive ecosystem with strong corporate backing from Google. It has a large and active community, along with comprehensive documentation, for deep learning.
